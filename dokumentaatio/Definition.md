## Topic Description

The topic of the project is to implement a simple convolutional neural network that can recognize the dance style of a song. Python will be used as the implementation language.

For testing the implementation I use Neural network implemented using TensorFlow. Afterwards, a simple convolutional neural network will be implemented without Tensorfowl Then, the performance of the peer implementation and the self-implemented convolutional neural network will be compared.

## Objectives

The goal is to implement a simple convolutional neural network that can recognize the dance style of a song. After this, the performance of the peer implementation and the self-implemented convolutional neural network will be compared.

## Implementation

The model will be trained using songs from which spectrograms are formed and processed in a way that emphasizes different parts of the rhythm. These spectrograms are fed into the convolutional neural network, which learns to recognize the dance styles based on the features of the spectrogram.
